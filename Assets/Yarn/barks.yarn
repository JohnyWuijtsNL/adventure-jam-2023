title: fireDemonPageText1
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: Fire demons exist as sentient and autonomous flames. #line:0f9d68d 
Player: They seek existing fires to possess, as their self-sufficiency is limited and they draw their power from a flame’s heat. #line:0d4b55d 
===

title: fireDemonPageText2
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: Fire demons have been known to agree to deals with humans, most often in smithies and kitchens. #line:02aa25f 
Player: They promise to maintain a constant fire in exchange for fuel and protected fire pits. #line:075ec36 
Player: However, many such a deal have ended in tragedy and fire demons should be considered highly unreliable. #line:06bf78a 
===

title: fireDemonPageText3
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark

Player: Above all, fire demons seek power: they will drive fires out of control to grow in strength, and will not stop until they have burnt everything within their reach. #line:08caf45 
===

title: fireDemonPageText4
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark

Player: If one comes across the remains of a fire-demon-fuelled flame, one might want to take the take to collect its ashes. #line:08ae6e0

===

title: bloodTreePageText1
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: Blood trees are incredibly interesting specimens, from a magical theory point of view. #line:0a99a0d 
Player: Born from the seed of an orchard tree sown into a bloodied battlefield blood, they do not have much to do with their parental tree, except from the fact that they bear fruits. #line:06b1218 
Player: While they are usually classified as a flesh-eating plant species, it would be more accurate to consider them blood-eating, as they suck their preys dry of blood and leave their corpses to rot between their roots. #line:081f637 
===

title: bloodTreePageText2
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: Many have theorised that blood trees own their sentience to the souls of those who died on their battlefield, explaining their antisocial and aggressive nature. #line:0cbb091 
Player: Blood trees do not understand joy, companionship or the concept of freely given gifts. They exist in a never-ending expanse of hatred. #line:065fddc 
===

title: bloodTreePageText3
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: Their fruits have the very alluring property of making the eater’s most fervent wish come true. #line:03eef57 
Player:This comes at a terrible cost : people who consume a blood fruit fall under the control of its mother tree. #line:0fdba27 
Player: One day, one month, one year later, they will enter a trance and make their way back to the tree, and die in its embrace. #line:090de61 
===

title: bloodTreePageText4
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: Blood trees have a symbiotic relationship with a rare species of mushroom with paralytic properties. #line:0b70cae 
Player: Ingestion, and sometimes mere contact, is enough to deaden all of its victim’s muscles. #line:0e9376b 
Player: Their honey is also highly toxic, as deadly as foxglove.

title: domesticTrollPageText1
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: Domestic trolls used to infest human homes. #line:08990ec 
Player: They were rarely seen, and ingratiated themselves to their human hosts by discreetly helping with domestic tasks, from cleaning the hearth to darning socks. #line:0402bbe 
===

title: domesticTrollPageText2
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: According to tradition, humans are supposed to reward their domestic troll with food. #line:07e82cd 
Player: The creatures’ diet were very similar to humans’, though they required far less food than us to survive. #line:0876827 
===

title: domesticTrollPageText3
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: Despite their apparent helpfulness, domestic trolls are treacherous pests, as more than one unsuspecting family has had to bear the consequences of. #line:01c2051 
Player: Their extremely controlling nature and their general aversion to change has resulted in more than one tragedy, such as families being locked into their houses for weeks on end by the beasts, or newborns being disposed of with the rubbish. #line:0179495 
===

title: domesticTrollPageText4
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: Contrary to popular belief, domestic trolls had not issue with heather bushes, so planting some around one’s house was not an effective way to dissuade them from moving in. #line:0262d80 
Player: Hawthorn, on the other hand, seemed to have more favourable results, probably because its berries were highly poisonous to the trolls. #line:05fb664 
===

title: laundryFaePageText1
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark

Player: Laundry fae are water-based fae that are most often sighted on river-sides washing clothes. #line:06f9b99 
Player: They seem to attach a lot of importance to clothing, and fabric and general, though they are not willing to explain why. #line:0f2f566 
===

title: laundryFaePageText2
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: They lure humans in, men and women alike, with their terribly beautiful appearances and their haunting singing voices. #line:0e8542e 
Player: Verily, scholars are not sure those fae have males and females individuals, as they all appear very attractive to whoever crosses their path. #line:096420d 
===

title: laundryFaePageText3
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: Laundry fae, like all fae, are highly capricious. They are just as likely to send you off with a gift than to drown you in their rivers. #line:07a38b2 
Player: They are so fickle that it is debatable whether they are actually sentient. #line:0e303c6

Player: The Three-and-one is a triadic creature that takes the appearance of three women, controlling aspects of the past, creation, and birth for the left-most one, the present, and life for the middle-one, the future, destruction and death for the right-most one. #line:0372751 
===

title: threeAndOnePageText2
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: The Three-and-one has been the topic of heated debates for many centuries, as some scholars believe it is a unique creature, while others claim there is an entire species of them. #line:03172bb 
Player: Indeed, the Three-and-one have been seen in many different places, but never twice in the same place, and according to existing records never in two different places at once. #line:0f1b252 
===

title: threeAndOnePageText3
tags: voice:need revision:none type:bark
---
Player: In our lands, the Three-and-One preferred tools seem to be a spindle to process yarn, a ruler to measure thread, and a pair of scissors to cut the thread. But different cultures have represented them in various ways. #line:068e2cb 
Player: The middle figure is supposedly keeping watch over the world through the eyes of crows. #line:03f2ab4
